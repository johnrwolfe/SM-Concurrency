# SM-Concurrency

This model is an attempt (likely a poor one) at using a class model to illustrate the 
key aspects of concurrency within the Shlaer-Mellor language.  At present, it focuses
only on concurrency within a single domain, but it was built with a view toward extension
to cover inter-domain communication (bridging).

There are two branches, each describing a slightly different way to view the notion of
an execution thread.
